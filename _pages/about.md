As a postdoctoral researcher at IHEP, I focus on the physical interpretation of LHAASO's cosmic ray sources. This is a new direction for me, moving away from gamma-ray burst studies, and I am excited by the challenge.

The studies at the student period
======
My research focuses on using gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as probes to study the physics of compact objects, particularly the properties of newly formed magnetars and black holes. 
By combining the X-ray flare and the X-ray plateau in the afterglow phase, we have investigated the magnetosphere size of magnetars and potential re-magnetization process of magnetar (Zheng et al. 2021). Through the search for potential quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signatures in GRBs, we have examined the activities of the central engines. A possible asymmetrical induced magnetar precession was identified in the afterglow of GRB\,101225A (Zou et al. 2021). The precession of the BH central engine is also suggested by GRB\,050904. Its X-ray afterglow, consisting of nine flares, features a QPO-modulated plateau and sharp decay, which cannot be easily explained by the magnetar model but favors a scenario involving a precessing jet powered by a Kerr BH (Zheng et al. 2024). We have also investigated long GRBs originating from ultra-compact binaries, revealing that the companion's long-term tidal force may imprint a QPO pattern in the GRB afterglow, providing a method for studying the evolution of multiplicity (Zheng et al. 2025). My latest study (Zheng et al., submitted) reveals that the periodicity in GRB events may be characterized by a time-evolving period. We report the first case of GRB,131122B, highlighting that its relative period change is the fastest observed in the electromagnetic window. Our work opens a new window for studying GRB central engines and related phenomena.
