I'm Tianci Zheng, a PhD student from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) and the [Purple Mountain Observatory](http://pmo.cas.cn/). 

Study interest
======
I’m majoring in High Energy Astrophysics, with a specific interest in the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Differing from the erratic prompt emission of GRBs, the canonical afterglow is a promising tool for probing the central engine of GRBs. Where the X-ray flares and the X-ray plateau connect the long-lasting central engine. By combining the X-ray flare and the X-ray plateau in the afterglow phase, we have studied the magnetar’s magnetosphere size and Its remagnetized process (Zheng et al. 2021). By searching for a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signature in the afterglow phase, the activities of the central engines were studied. A possible asymmetrical induced magnetar precession was identified from the afterglow of the Christmas burst, GRB 101225A, which shows a tentative QPO signature in the phase of the energy dissipation dominated by gravitational wave (Zou et al. 2021). The precession of BH central therefore also expected to be found in the afterglow of GRBs. The X-ray afterglow of GRB050904, comprising nine flares, is characterized by a QPO-modulated plateau and sharp decay, which cannot be readily explained by the magnetar model but favors a Kerr BH powered precessing jet scenario (Zheng et al. 2024).
