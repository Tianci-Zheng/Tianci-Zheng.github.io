Hi! Friend, nice  to meet you here~

I'm Tianci Zheng, a postgraduate student from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) and the [Purple Mountain Observatory](http://pmo.cas.cn/). 

Study interesting
======
I'm majoring in High Energy Astrophysics, the field of the X-ray afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
Differing from the erratic prompt emission of GRBs, the canonical afterglow is a promising tool for probing the central engine of GRBs. Where the X-ray flares and the X-ray plateau connect the long-lasting central engine. By combining the flare and the X-ray plateau in the afterglow phase, we study the magnetosphere size of magnetar, the remagnetization of magnetar. We futher find possible signals that connect the precessional of magnetar and the Kerr black hole, respectively.

For further interest, please found the publications from my private [ADS library]( https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/lgsSLQwzQ0GLO3hxMgFZjA)
