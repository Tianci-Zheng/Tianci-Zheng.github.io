Hi! Friend, nice  to meet you here~

I'm Tianci Zheng, a PhD student from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) and the [Purple Mountain Observatory](http://pmo.cas.cn/). 

Study interest
======
I'm majoring in High Energy Astrophysics, with a specific intrest in the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
Differing from the erratic prompt emission of GRBs, the canonical afterglow is a promising tool for probing the central engine of GRBs. Where the X-ray flares and the X-ray plateau connect the long-lasting central engine. By combining the X-ray flare and the X-ray plateau in the afterglow phase, we studied the magnetar's magnetosphere size and Its remagnetized process. We further found possible signals that connect the precessional of magnetar and the Kerr black hole, respectively.

For detailed studies please find the publications from my private [ADS library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/lgsSLQwzQ0GLO3hxMgFZjA)
