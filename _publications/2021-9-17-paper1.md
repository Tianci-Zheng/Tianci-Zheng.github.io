title: " X-ray flares raising upon magnetar plateau as an implication of a surrounding disk of newborn magnetized neutron star"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-9-17-paper1
excerpt: 'Combining with the X-ray flare and internal magnetar plateau, we identify the central magnetar of certain GRBs are surrounding by a disk. Based on the connection between multi-flare and a steady-state disk, the size of magnetospheres is estimated. Furthermore, we discussed the possible remagnetization of an accretion-material-buried magnetar. We suggest that the remagnetized process of a newborn magnetar in GRB may be dominated by interior convection. We find possible evidence in the X-ray afterglow of GRB 111209A, which shows a significant luminosity from dark climb to normal after a bright flare.'
