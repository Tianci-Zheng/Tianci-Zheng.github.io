title: " X-ray flares and plateau explore magnetar properties"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-9-17-paper1
excerpt: 'Combining with Xray flare and internal plateau, we indentify centeral magnetar is surrounding by a disk.Basing on the connection between multiflare and steaty-state disk, the size of magnetosphere is estimated. Furthermore, we  discussed the possible remagnetization process of a material-burried magnetar. We suggest that the remagnetization process of a neborn magnetar in GRB may dominate by the interior convection. We find a possible evidence in the X-ray afterglow of GRB 111209A, which show a significant luminosity from dark climb to normal after a bright flare. '
