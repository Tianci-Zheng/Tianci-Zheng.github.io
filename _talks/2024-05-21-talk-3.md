Comments (answers were organized after the conference): 
  * Runcao Chen (NJU) & ?? (Sun Yat-sen University) : what causes the disk to misalignment with the spin axis of a black hole.
    * Answer: It's complicated. To be honest we never considered this question while we organized this study, and treated it as a prerequisite.  Firstly, the misalignment of a disk may lead to a SN-kick, while the progenitor collapses or merges. Secondly, asymmetrical explosion leads to asymmetrical fallback of material. Finally, the neglected companion star gives a force to the newborn black hole.
