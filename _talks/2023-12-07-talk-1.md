The talk shares two works in which we use the X-ray flare and plateau as a tool for probing the GRB central engine. detail information please see the the first two publications.

Comments (answers was organized after the conferenence): 
  * Prof. Bing Zhang: where is the photosphere? can you give a comparise with the magnetosphere?
   * I's about 10^{9} to 10^10} cm, far away from the central engine, one significent larger than the magnetosphere. Therefore, the light would not shade by the magnetophere.
  * 徐仁新教授： 在中文中，magnetosphere翻译成磁层，报告中使用磁球，这应该是不合适的
    * 改！
  * Prof. Jinjun Geng: where is the light cylinder?
    * It's a bit larger than magnetosphere, one well favors the accretion assmption! 
    * In the paper there three multi-flare existed GRB afterglows, GRB 050730,060607A and 140304A. The magnetosphere's radiu of these three GRB are estimated to be 5.01 × 10^{6} cm, 6.45 × 10^{6}ccm, and 1.09 × 10^{7} cm, respectively. The light cylinder can be easily derived from the spin period of centeral magnetar, they are 7.07，17.10，12.95 （x 10^{6} cm） respectively. Results hint that our model consistent the physical assumption, accretion indueced flare.
