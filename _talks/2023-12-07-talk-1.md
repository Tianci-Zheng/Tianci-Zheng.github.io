[Finding the talk in the publications](https://tianci-zheng.github.io/publications/)

The talk shares two works in which we use the X-ray flare and plateau as a tool for probing the GRB central engine. detail information please see the the first two publications.

Comments (answers were organized after the conference): 
  * Prof. Bing Zhang: where is the photosphere? can you give a comparison with the magnetosphere?
   * It's about 10^{9} to 10^10} cm, far away from the central engine, one significantly larger than the magnetosphere. Therefore, the light would not be shaded by the magnetosphere.
  * 徐仁新教授： 在中文中，‘magnetosphere’ 现在是约定翻译成磁层，报告中使用磁球，可以统一一下。
    * 改！
  * Prof. Jinjun Geng: where is the light cylinder?
    * It's a bit larger than the magnetosphere, one well favors the accretion assumption! 
    * In the paper, there are three multi-flare existing GRB afterglows, GRB 050730,060607A, and 140304A. The magnetosphere's radius of these three GRB's central engines are estimated to be 5.01 × 10^{6} cm, 6.45 × 10^{6} cm, and 1.09 × 10^{7} cm, respectively. The light cylinder can be easily derived from the spin period of a central magnetar, they are 7.07，17.10，12.95 （× 10^{6} cm） respectively. Results hint that our model is consistent with the physical assumption, the accretion-induced flare.
